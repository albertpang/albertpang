- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @albertpang
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m have a degree in structural engineering, and an interest in architecture.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new things.

I have a couple projects ongoing related to the interests that I have.
A majority of my time is consumed with my updated PyAutoCAD module that uses Python to draft and review AutoCAD DWGs.
